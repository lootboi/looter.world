I am @AltLoot, Solidity enjoyer and developer based in the US.

While I am an EVM maximalist, I also enjoy building things with Node.js and JavaScript.
I got into web3 development after getting rekt yield farming but have been in crypto since 2015.

Much like my name, I like seeking value in alternative strategies, code based or not.
My favorite project right now is Avalanche based subnets which allow for platforms to create their own, essentially gasless, decentralized networks.

This is my personal website. It is a collection of my personal projects, thoughts, and opinions.
While I may work with other platforms, these are all of my own thoughts.
